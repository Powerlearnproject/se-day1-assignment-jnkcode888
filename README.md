Software Engineering Day 1 Assignment

Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
What’s the big deal about software engineering?
Let me break it down: Software engineering is like building a digital bridge. Instead of steel and concrete, you use code and design patterns to create reliable, scalable apps. Why does it matter? Imagine your bank app crashing every time you transfer money—chaos, right? Bad software can tank businesses or even risk lives (think medical devices). Good engineering keeps systems from falling apart.

Three game-changers in software history

1968’s “Oops, We Need Rules” Moment: The NATO conference basically said, “Hey, our software projects are a mess.” They invented the term “software engineering” to push for discipline.

1970s Code Cleanup: Edsger Dijkstra and pals argued, “Let’s stop writing spaghetti code!” Structured programming made code readable—like swapping a junk drawer for labeled folders.

2001’s Agile Rebellion: Tired of rigid plans, a group of devs wrote the Agile Manifesto. Suddenly, teams could pivot faster than a TikTok trend.

SDLC phases—no jargon, I promise
Picture building a house:

Planning: “We need a 3-bedroom, 2-bath home by December.”

Design: Blueprints and paint samples (but for software).

Development: Hammering nails = writing code.

Testing: Inspecting for leaky pipes (bugs).

Deployment: Moving in day!

Maintenance: Fixing the AC when it breaks in July.

Waterfall vs. Agile: The showdown

Waterfall is your grandma’s recipe: Follow steps exactly. Great for projects where changes are a nightmare—like building a satellite.

Agile is a jazz improv session. Perfect for startups where the boss says, “Wait, users want a llama emoji button now?!”

Who does what in the coding circus?

Developers: The magicians turning coffee into code.

QA Engineers: Professional nitpickers (bless them).

Project Managers: The glue holding everyone together. Pro tip: Without a PM, deadlines vanish like socks in a dryer.

IDEs and Git—why bother?

IDEs: Imagine writing a novel with a typewriter vs. Google Docs. Tools like VS Code autocomplete your code and catch typos.

Git: It’s a time machine for code. Mess up? Rewind. Teammate deleted your work? Git’s got your back.

Coding headaches (and aspirin)

Scope creep: Clients adding “just one tiny feature” daily. Fix: Agile sprints.

Bugs from hell: That glitch that only happens on full moons. Fix: Test early, test often.

Deadline dread: When Friday feels like a cliff. Fix: Prioritize like your WiFi’s about to die.

Testing types—the quality squad

Unit tests: Checking if a light switch works.

Integration tests: Making sure the switch doesn’t blow up the fridge.

System tests: Pretending you’re a user who hates reading manuals.

Acceptance tests: The client’s final “Yep, this doesn’t suck” stamp.

Part 2: AI & Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering: Talking to robots 101
It’s like giving GPS directions to an AI. Vague prompt: “How do I cook?” → You get a 10-page essay on fire. Good prompt: “Give me 3 quick chicken recipes for picky toddlers.” Specificity = edible results.

Fix this space prompt: “Tell me about space”

Bad version: Too broad. The AI might rant about black holes AND astronaut laundry.

Fixed: “List 3 weird facts about Saturn’s rings discovered since 2020.” Now the AI stays on track—no random moon landing tangents.
